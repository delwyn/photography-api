  description: "This spot directly opposite the Houses of Parliament is a great place to go to get a view of this iconic building and the Elizabeth Tower which houses Big Ben. The bridge itself works as a great leading line and there are a few different angles you can get around this spot using the tunnel, steps and hospital part behind you.<P>This spot is accessible 24 hours a day, but it's best to visit for sunset and blue hour where you can get some fantastic light coming from behind the subject.<P>The place can get busy with other photographers, especially during the summer, so if you really want to get a shot from a particular spot you may wish to arrive there early.",

  description: "This is one of the icons of London that you will want to shoot on your visit, and there are some great angles to be had of it from both sides of the river. <P>Security immediately around the London Eye will not allow you to use a tripod. If you stand directly in front of the wheel they will likely also ask you to stop taking photos even if you're doing so handheld. At low tide you can gain access to the area under the wheel via the beach, but this is private property and you will be shouted at to clear off. No signs are in place due to the water levels at full tide. <P>As such, speed is needed here so grab shots while you can before the security arrive and tell you to clear off. Wearing headphones will allow you to ignore any calls to stop that they may shout in your direction which will of course buy you more time before they are suddenly stood beside you.<P>Try moving back a bit from the wheel to have less hassle. The lovely Jubilee Gardens offers some nice vantage points, and you can go across the river directly opposite the Eye to get a straight on view.",

  description: "The Tate Modern is a cool museum that's contained within an old power station. It can often have some great exhibits, some of which are on a large scale in the Turbine Hall and it also has a nice river facing view from the public cafe. <P>Being an old power station, the museum itself is also pretty cool to look at and you should be able to get some worthwhile shots from various angles simply looking up at the building. <P>I prefer to shoot this building during the daytime with interesting clouds in the sky. The spotlights at the foot of the main tower at night time are pretty bright and don't look great in an image.",

  description: "This museum has some amazing architecture, so be sure to head inside even if you aren't really interested in any of the exhibitions. <P>After walking in the main entrance you will enter the Great Hall which has a beautiful roof designed by Norman Foster. You can get many great images looking up at this from various parts of the hall. <P>If you come into the main entrance and go up some stairs on the left, instead of moving forward to the Great Hall, then you can get to a great viewing window which looks down on to the Great Hall itself (pictured here).<P>Then of course there are some good shots to be had at the exhibitions themselves, a particular favourite being the Egyptian Collection in wing 4 (left centre of the Great Hall). <P>No tripods are allowed within the museum or the grounds; though in some areas of the grounds you can often get away with it when away from the regular flow of people.",
